# PROFILES ALTERNATING FILE
# SPECIAL FORMAT: indicated by -ALTERNATING- in the filename
#   - Combines data from two different profile measurements:
#     conventional profile and CO2/H2O profile
#   - Rows start w/ data record ID
#   - Rows w/ record ID 225 contain data from the conventional profile
#   - Rows w/ record ID 1 contain data from the CO2/H2O profile
#   - Because of these two IDs this filetype needs an additional set of
#     *data_vars*, which is defined below as *data_vars2*.
#   - Does not have varnames in header
#   - Timestamp needs to be built from DOY
#   - Timestamp of CO2/H2O profile is not regular: 9-11 MIN
#   - Is often irregular (check *data_keep_good_rows* option)
#   - data_keep_good_rows: [ 0, 225 ] --> 225 is good data for the conventional profile
#   - data_keep_good_rows: [ 0, 1 ] --> 1 is good data for the CO2/H2O profile
#   File format with data from the conventional profile and data
#   from the CO2 and H2O profile.
#   Info from the file grasslandserver/export/home/davos/config/README:
#     > Until 12.06.2006 we had simple logger files from Davos named meteo*.
#     > From 13.06.2006 onwards we have a new format with two different record IDs:
#     > 225: conventional profile data
#     > 1:   CO2 and H2O profile data
#   The record ID at the start of each data row shows which data were recorded
#   in the respective row.
#   *data_vars* info for the conventional profile used from file:
#   - grasslandserver/export/home/davos/config/config.header.bis20060612
#   - (no previous config file)
